X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play
an all important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to
its limit, if you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of
the challenges.
First you'll try just to complete the levels, while later you'll compete
with yourself and others, racing against the clock.
